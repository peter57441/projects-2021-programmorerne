# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Data project: Connection between education level and unemployment** and examines whether the education level can explain the unemployment for different age groups.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

This **loads two datasets**:

1. HFUDD11_ny.xlsx downloaded from statistikbanekn.dk/HFUDD11
1. AUL01.xlsx downloaded from statistikbanekn.dk/AUL01

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no futher installations.
