# Inaugural project

This assignment analyzes a simplified emulation of the tax reform on housing that will be implemented in Denmark in 2024. We solve the optimization problem for a household who gets utility from housing and consumption of other goods. Furthermore, the analysis consists of a computation of the average tax burden and calculations of the base housing tax that will ensure that the average tax burden does not change with the reform. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
